This tutorial letter will help you quickly learnòPòhow to use LeScript by guiding you through many of LeScript's functions...stepòPòby step.Œ As you read this letter, you will learn how to delete, add text, moveòPòtext, print, create Headers and Footers, and many other valuable points you canòPòuse to help you begin writing with LeScript.Œ The LeScript instruction manualòPòitself gives a complete and detailed description of each of LeScript's powerfulòPòediting functions and printer commands, but using this on-screen tutorial we canòPòshow exactly what to do and how to do it, as well as show you right on theòPòscreen what you just did!!òPòòPò	The first thing that everyone wants to do is see something print out onòPòtheir printer.Œ So why don't we do that first?Œ Turn to the quick reference cardòPòin the back of the LeScript manual and find your printer listed under theòPòsection that says "PRINTER DRIVER LIST".Œ You will notice that some printers areòPòlisted twice, once for mono-space operation (each character is the same width asòPòall the others) and another time for proportional-space operation (bigòPòcharacters take up more space than smaller characters).Œ To the left of whereòPòyour printer is listed you will see a "K" followed by a number.Œ This is theòPòprinter command that you use in your text to tell LeScript what kind of printeròPòyou have.Œ For example, if your printer is a Radio Shack DMP-2100, and you wishòPòto use that printer in proportional-space mode, the printer command you wouldòPòuse is K71.Œ If your printer is not found in this list, use K0.Œ Once you'veòPòfound the K command for your printer, either mono-space or proportional-space,òPògo back up to the top of this letter, find where it says K0 and change it to theòPòcommand for your printer.Œ If you are using single sheets of paper in youròPòprinter, follow the K printer command with ",I" (no quotes).Œ Now turn youròPòprinter on and get it ready, then hold down the CTRL key and hit the P key.ŒòPòThis letter should now be printing in final format -- properly justified, withòPòall headers and page numbers automatically installed.òPòòPò	By now you've probably figured out how to move your þCþþUþþRþþSþþOþþRþ around theòPòtext by using the four arrow keys on your keyboard.Œ But incase you haven't,òPòlets cover cursor movements next.Œ To move the cursor around the text simply useòPòthe four arrow keys on your keyboard.Œ If the arrow keys are superimposed on theòPònumeric key-pad, as they are on most IBM-style keyboards, then you will useòPòthese four keys.Œ Users of Keytronic optional keyboards would also use the fouròPòarrow keys on the numeric key-pad.Œ The NUM LOCK key has no affect whileòPòLeScript is running.Œ This is to allow LeScript to totally dedicate the use ofòPòthe keys in the numeric key-pad to the word processing functions which areòPòindicated on the faces of these keys; i.e. HOME, PG UP, etc.Œ Go ahead and tryòPòusing all the arrow keys (one at a time, of course!).Œ Notice that if you holdòPòthem down, they move continuously.Œ Now, for one of LeScript's time- andòPòeffort-saving features!Œ Hold down the SHIFT key and press the left or rightòPòarrow.Œ Your cursor, as you can see, moves to the left-most or right-most columnòPòof your text, depending on which arrow key you hit.òPòòPò	Before moving on, note that all of LeScript's editing functions areòPòinvoked in one of three ways:Œ Holding down the CTRL key and striking anotheròPòkey (for example, the INSERT mode command could be denoted:Œ CTRL-I); HoldingòPòdown the SHIFT key and another key (for example, SHIFT- denotes the SCROLL-UPòPòfunction); and holding down both the CTRL and SHIFT keys and striking anotheròPòkey (for example, SHIFT-CTRL-0 gives control back to DOS).òPòòPò	OK, now that cursor movement and key-stroke syntax are taken care of,òPòlet me show you the one feature you may need the most, at least in theòPòbeginning, and that is the þHþþEþþLþþPþþ þþSþþCþþRþþEþþEþþNþ function.Œ For this function to work youòPòmust have a copy of LESCRIPT.HLP on your default disk drive.Œ If you followedòPòthe backup procedures in the LeScript instruction manual, then you probably do,òPòalready.Œ Then all you have to do is hold down the CTRL key and hit the questionòPòmark key (no shift).Œ We call this hitting CTRL-?.Œ When you do this, LeScriptòPòremoves the current document from the screen, saves it in memory, loads in theòPòhelp file (LESCRIPT.HLP) from the disk and displays it on the screen.Œ With theòPòcursor control key you can scroll the help file up or down to display on theòPòscreen the section that you need help in.Œ Once you have your questions answeredòPòfrom looking them up in the help file, just hit CTRL-? again and your originalòPòtext file comes back to the screen.Œ CTRL-? again and the help file is back onòPòthe screen.Œ It's just that simple.Œ Now that you know how to do it, try theòPòHELP SCREEN function, and see how easy it is to get help on any of the editingòPòfunctions or printer commands anytime you need it.òPòòPò	The Help Screen feature can also be used as an þAþþLþþTþþEþþRþþNþþAþþTþþEþ þTþþEþþXþþTþ þEþþDþþIþþTþþIþþNþþGþòPòþSþþCþþRþþEþþEþþNþ.Œ Try hitting CTRL-? to get into the help/alternate text screen, then hitòPòCTRL-0 twice to clear the screen of the help file, then type anything you wish.ŒòPòYou can use this alternate screen just like the main screen, to create, edit, oròPòexamine more than one file in LeScript at a time.Œ It's like having two wordòPòprocessors in one.Œ You can even move blocks of text back and forth between theòPòtwo sides using the CTRL-M and CTRL-C functions, which I will be explainingòPòlater.òPòòPò	The þDþþIþþRþþEþþCþþTþþOþþRþþYþ function is a good one to cover next.Œ Before you try it,òPòlet me explain first what to expect and how to return to the text edit mode whenòPòthe directory is on the screen.Œ Hitting CTRL-D will momentarily remove the textòPòfrom the screen to be stored in the computer's memory, then a listing of theòPòfirst 20 files on the default disk drive will be displayed on the screen.Œ ToòPòget the next 20 file names hit the SPACE key.Œ To get a listing of file names onòPòanother drive just hit the letter key of that drive (A, B, C, or D).Œ To returnòPòback to the text, hit CTRL-Z.Œ If you hit a letter key of a drive that doesn'tòPòhave a disk in it, then hit CTRL-Z to recover.Œ OK, now you can try it.òPòòPò	þLþþOþþAþþDþþIþþNþþGþþ þþaþþ þþFþþiþþlþþeþ into LeScript using the directory is as simple as movingòPòthe cursor to the file name while a directory is on the screen and hittingòPòCTRL-G (the G means "get a file").Œ If you load a file from the directory whenòPòthere is already a file in LeScript, then the new file will get appended to (oròPòmerged into) the first text file at the place where the cursor was when CTRL-DòPòwas struck.Œ This is a very powerful ability of LeScript that is not commonlyòPòfound on other word processors.Œ You can try this þlþþaþþtþþeþþrþ, since loading anotheròPòfile into the middle of this one right now would just confuse things a bit.òPòòPò	Now let's get a little fancy with the directory function by getting aòPòþSþþEþþLþþEþþCþþTþþIþþVþþEþþ þþDþþIþþRþþEþþCþþTþþOþþRþþYþ list.Œ Let's say we want a list of just the file names onòPòdrive "A" that end in ".DOC".Œ It's simple.Œ Just create a blank line by hittingòPòCTRL-O (you can do this as you're reading it), and type "A:????????.DOC" (noòPòquotes), then hit CTRL-D.Œ Second example: to get all files on drive "B" thatòPòstart with the letter "A", just type "B:A???????.???" on a blank line, and hitòPòCTRL-D.Œ To have þaþþlþþlþ file names listed again it's "A:????????.???" and CTRL-D.òPòòPò	While I have you in the directory, we could try þKþþIþþLþþLþþIþþNþþGþþ þþaþþ þþFþþIþþLþþEþ.Œ IfòPòthere is a file you think you don't need on the disk anymore, to get rid of itòPòjust hit CTRL-D to display the directory, move the cursor to the file you wantòPòto kill, and hit CTRL-K twice.Œ The first time you are warned, the second timeòPòthe file is removed from the disk.Œ Now before we leave the directory function,òPòhow would you like a þPþþRþþIþþNþþTþþEþþDþþ þþDþþIþþRþþEþþCþþTþþOþþRþþYþþ þþLþþIþþSþþTþþIþþNþþGþ just as it appears on theòPòscreen?Œ Well, that's easy too!Œ Just hit CTRL-D to get to the directory, turnòPòyour printer on and get it ready, then just hit SHIFT-PRTSC.Œ Remember thatòPòCTRL-Z will get you back to the text edit mode when you're done.Œ Go ahead andòPòprint out a few directories for yourself -- I'll wait for you at the nextòPòparagraph.òPòòPò	Oh good, now that you are back I think I'd like to explain the funnyòPòlittle squares that you see at the end of every sentence.Œ These are calledòPòþEþþNþþDþþ-þþOþþFþþ-þþSþþEþþNþþTþþEþþNþþCþþEþþ þþcþþhþþaþþrþþaþþcþþtþþeþþrþþsþ.Œ This character creates an additional amount ofòPòspace between sentences, and is entered þaþþuþþtþþoþþmþþaþþtþþiþþcþþaþþlþþlþþyþ by LeScript when you typeòPòtwo spaces after a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point.Œ NoticeòPòthat these characters printed as blanks when you printed this letter.Œ At theòPòend of every paragraph notice that there is another character; this is a

paragraphs.Œ Notice that neitheròPòof these two characters show up on the paper when you printed out this letter.ŒòPòTo þIþþNþþDþþEþþNþþTþþ

þþmþþoþþdþþeþ.Œ The View mode allows you to see the text on theòPòscreen in final format without having to print it out on paper.Œ When you getòPòinto VIEW mode, which I will tell you how to do in a second, the screen will goòPòblank; hold down the down-arrow key until your text appears.Œ To terminate theòPòVIEW mode and get back to the text, either use CTRL-Z, or just continue holdingòPòdown the down-arrow key until you reach the end of the letter and LeScript willòPòautomatically take you back to the text. O.K., let's go!Œ Use CTRL-V and GO FORòPòIT!!Œ See how great it works?Œ Continue to hold down the down-arrow key to viewòPòthe entire letter.Œ Notice that LeScript won't let you scroll backwards while inòPòthis mode.Œ And notice, also, as you page through the letter, that the headersòPòand page numbers are automatically inserted into the letter where they belong.òPòòPò	Next let's cover the þDþþEþþLþþEþþTþþEþ and þIþþNþþSþþEþþRþþTþ functions.Œ First, move theòPòcursor to the first letter of the first word of this paragraph, then hit theòPòDELETE key.Œ Bingo!Œ You just deleted a character.Œ To put it back, hit theòPòINSERT (or INS) key (which puts you in INSERT mode...notice that the cursor isòPòthicker in this mode), and type in the original character.Œ You're still inòPòINSERT mode, so why don't you try typing in a couple words, a sentence, oròPòwhatever?Œ To get out of INSERT mode, just hit the INSERT key again.Œ ForòPòcompatibility with earlier versions of LeScript CTRL- can also be used toòPòdelete characters, and CTRL-I can also be used to insert.Œ And there you haveòPòit!!òPòòPò	O.K., now let's continue with other kinds of deletes.Œ You can deleteòPòthe character(s) in þfþþrþþoþþnþþtþ of the cursor.Œ Position your cursor on the "s" inòPò"position" and hit BACK SPACE (or CTRL-).Œ The "o" disappears!Œ Now you can useòPòINSERT (or CTRL-I) to put it back if you want to.Œ Let's þDþþEþþLþþEþþTþþEþþ þþaþþ þþWþþOþþRþþDþ!Œ MoveòPòthe cursor to the "M" in the first word of this sentence; now hit CTRL-W and theòPòword "Move" is deleted.Œ Now let's þDþþEþþLþþEþþTþþEþþ þþaþþ þþLþþIþþNþþEþ.Œ Move the cursor to theòPòbeginning of any line (preferably one you've already read) and hit CTRL-L.ŒòPòPresto, it's gone!!Œ CTRL-L will delete any part of the line from the cursor andòPòfollowing (so, if you only want to delete the last half of a line, move theòPòcursor to the middle of the line and hit CTRL-L).Œ CTRL-* (no shift) can be usedòPòto þDþþEþþLþþEþþTþþEþþ þþaþþ þþWþþHþþOþþLþþEþþ þþBþþLþþOþþCþþKþ of text.Œ I will explain this in a minute.òPòòPò	Let's change the format of the text, now.Œ First let's þMþþOþþVþþEþþ þþaþþ þþBþþLþþOþþCþþKþþ þþoþþfþòPòþtþþeþþxþþtþ.Œ How about this sentence?Œ Position your cursor on the "H" of the previousòPòsentence and hit CTRL-B.Œ This puts a þBþþLþþOþþCþþKþþ þþMþþAþþRþþKþþEþþRþþ þþcþþhþþaþþrþþaþþcþþtþþeþþrþ in front of theòPò"H".Œ Now move to the beginning of the next sentence (position the cursor on theòPò"P" in "Position").Œ Hit CTRL-B again.Œ You have just finished defining a BLOCKòPòof text.Œ You can MOVE it, COPY it or DELETE it.Œ Let's MOVE it and put it afteròPòthis sentence.Œ Move your cursor to the "M" in the word "Move" at the beginningòPòof this sentence and then hit CTRL-M to move the BLOCK.Œ That was certainlyòPòpretty easy, huh?Œ Notice that the BLOCK MARKER characters are still there.ŒòPòThis means that you can still MOVE this sentence somewhere else or þCþþOþþPþþYþþ þþtþþhþþeþòPòþBþþLþþOþþCþþKþþ þþoþþfþþ þþtþþeþþxþþtþ to another place if you want to, just by moving your cursor toòPòthat place and hitting CTRL-C.Œ Or, if you're done with the block, you canòPòremove the BLOCK MARKER characters by hitting CTRL-Q.Œ To þDþþEþþLþþEþþTþþEþþ þþaþþ þþBþþLþþOþþCþþKþþ þþoþþfþþ þþtþþeþþxþþtþòPòjust move the cursor to the end of the block of text to delete, hit CTRL-B, moveòPòthe cursor to the beginning of the block, and then hit CTRL-* (no shift).Œ LetsòPòtry that on this paragraph.Œ Move the cursor to the beginning of this sentenceòPòand hit CTRL-B.Œ Then move the cursor to the beginning of this paragraph and hitòPòCTRL-* (no shift).Œ The first half of this paragraph just got deleted.Œ WhatòPòcould be simpler than that?!òPòòPò	What about moving blocks of text between the two different editingòPòscreens?Œ Well, we can do that too!!Œ Move your cursor to the beginning of thisòPòparagraph and hit CTRL-B.Œ Now move the cursor to the end of this paragraph andòPòhit CTRL-B again.Œ To move this block to the text in the other editing screenòPòjust hit CTRL-?

"Width:80"?Œ Let's change it to 64.ŒòPòTo get the cursor into the NAME field hit CTRL-= (no shift) and then use youròPòright-arrow key to move over to the "8" in "80".Œ Just type "64" (no

finished, come back toòPòthis paragraph (using PG DN) and we'll continue.òPòòPò	O.K., let's VIEW the text again, in its new format.Œ Hit CTRL-V and holdòPòthe down-arrow key.Œ Not bad, eh?Œ You'll find that the power LeScript gives youòPòis almost limitless, not to mention that LeScript is incredibly easy to use!ŒòPòAfter you have VIEWED a couple of pages in this new format, you may use CTRL-ZòPòto get back to the text.òPòòPò	Now let's try þUþþNþþDþþEþþRþþLþþIþþNþþIþþNþþGþ.Œ Position your cursor anywhere you like andòPòhit CTRL-4.Œ Notice that that LeScript underlined that character, if you have aòPòTANDY-2000 or a standard IBM-type monochrome monitor.Œ If you have a standardòPòIBM-type color monitor (which can't display underlines in character mode)òPòLeScript will change the color of the underlined text to purple.Œ To getòPòþBþþOþþLþþDþþFþþAþþCþþEþ text just move the cursor to the word(s) that you want bolded and hitòPòCTRL-3 once for each character.Œ If you have a standard IBM-type monochrome oròPòcolor display or a TANDY-2000 monochrome display, the boldface text will beòPòdisplayed in higher intensity than the normal text.Œ If you have a TANDY-2000òPòcolor monitor the boldface text will also display in a contrasting coloròPò(initially its purple, but can be changed, explained later).Œ To þSþþUþþPþþEþþRþþSþþCþþRþþIþþPþþTþþ þaòPòcharacter, hit CTRL-1.Œ LeScript shows you that a character is superscripted byòPòdisplaying the character itself on the screen alternating back-and-forth with anòPòup-arrow.Œ This looks like: þsþþuþþpþþeþþrþþsþþcþþrþþiþþpþþtþ.Œ To þSþþUþþBþþSþþCþþRþþIþþPþþTþ a character, hit CTRL-2.ŒòPòLeScript shows subscripted characters by alternating the characteròPòback-and-forth with a down-arrow.Œ This looks like: þsþþuþþbþþsþþcþþrþþiþþpþþtþ.Œ þIþþTþþAþþLþþIþþCþþSþ are doneòPòby hitting CTRL-5.Œ LeScript displays italics like: þiþþtþþaþþlþþiþþcþ.Œ When these wordsòPòare printed on one of the printers listed in the LeScript instruction manual,òPòthey will actually print out boldface, underlined, italicized, etc. (providedòPòthe printer has the capability).Œ Well, since this is so easy, how about tryingòPòto bold, underline, etc., some of the words in this paragraph.Œ To reverse thisòPòfunction, for example to "unbolded" a word, just go back over the word withòPòCTRL-3 again.Œ Try un-doing all the bold, underlines, italics, superscripts, andòPòsubscripts in this paragraph by using the same keys used to make theòPòenhancement. LeScript also gives you the ability to toggle off-and-on theòPò"blinking" of these character attributes by hitting CTRL-".òPòòPò	Do you have a color monitor?Œ Would you like to þcþþhþþaþþnþþgþþeþþ þþtþþhþþeþþ þþcþþoþþlþþoþþrþþ þþoþþfþþ þþtþþhþþeþòPòþtþþeþþxþþtþ?Œ Just hit CTRL-[.Œ On standard IBM-type color systems you have 7 differentòPòcolors to choose from.Œ On the TANDY-2000 you have 15 different colors.Œ HowòPòabout the background color of the text?Œ Just hit SHIFT-CTRL-[ and theòPòbackground color changes.Œ On standard IBM-type color monitors you can alsoòPòchange the color of þuþþnþþdþþeþþrþþlþþiþþnþþeþþdþ text with CTRL-].Œ On TANDY-2000 color systems,òPòCTRL-] changes the color of þbþþoþþlþþdþ text.Œ And SHIFT-CTRL-] will change theòPòbackground color of þiþþtþþaþþlþþiþþcþ text on standard IBM-type color monitors.Œ OnòPòTANDY-2000 color systems though, SHIFT-CTRL-] changes the background color ofòPòþbþþoþþlþþdþ text.Œ OK, it's time now to give your eyes a thrill!Œ We have þbþþoþþlþþdþ,òPòþuþþnþþdþþeþþrþþlþþiþþnþþeþ, þiþþtþþaþþlþþiþþcþ -- now use these four commands and see how these change coloròPòon you screen (color systems only).Œ Stop on a set of colors you like best andòPògo on with the letter.òPòòPò	Next let's add some FOOTERS to this letter. It's very easy withòPòLeScript, and it looks þsþþoþ professional!Œ If you'll look at the very start ofòPòthis tutorial letter, the 2nd through 11th printer command lines, you can seeòPòhow we formatted the þHþþEþþAþþDþþEþþRþþSþ.Œ The second printer command line at the veryòPòbeginning of the letter is the "Start-Header" command line, which tells LeScriptòPòthat the next few lines are formatting lines just for the Headers.Œ "HE" andòPò"HO" start the Headers for the þeþþvþþeþþnþ pages and the þoþþdþþdþ pages, respectively.Œ IfòPòwe had wanted the Header to be the same on all pages, we would have used onlyòPò"H".Œ You will put your Footer format lines under our Header format lines (afteròPòthe line that says, "z").Œ Let's do the Footers the same on every page.Œ We'llòPòcenter the words "LESCRIPT DEMO" 4 lines below the last line of the text body.òPòòPò	To begin, position your cursor on the "jb,t10..." line and hit CTRL-OòPòfour times.Œ Now you have four blank lines on which to type your Footer commandòPòlines.Œ The first line you type (the "Start-Footer" command line) will consistòPòof a þPþþRþþIþþNþþTþþEþþRþ þCþþOþþMþþMþþAþþNþþDþþ þþcþþhþþaþþrþþaþþcþþtþþeþþrþ (CTRL-;), followed by "F" (no quotes) and aòPòRETURN character (ENTER).Œ For the next line (the "Footer Format" commandòPòline), type CTRL-; and "jc,gr4,m0" (no quotes) and hit ENTER.Œ This tellsòPòLeScript that the justification for the footer will be centered (jc), it willòPòstart 4 lines down (gr4), and the left margin will be 0 (m0).Œ For the thirdòPòline (the "Footer Body" text line), type LESCRIPT DEMO and hit ENTER. For theòPòlast line (the "End-Footer" command line) type CTRL-; and "z" (no quotes) andòPòhit ENTER.Œ YouòPòhave finished!Œ Now go ahead and VIEW it in final format (CTRL-V and theòPòdown-arrow key).Œ Notice that LeScript puts the "LESCRIPT DEMO" footer lineòPòat the bottom of every page.Œ Wasn't that incredibly easy?!òPòòPò	How about the þSþþEþþAþþRþþCþþHþ and þRþþEþþPþþLþþAþþCþþEþ functions, which enable you to search foròPòa "string" of characters and replace them with another string?Œ Let's replaceòPòthe word "character" in this tutorial with the words "Tribal Warrior".Œ First,òPòuse CTRL-= to put the cursor in the first status line.Œ Hit the down-arrow keyòPòto move the cursor to the SH (SEARCH) field.Œ Type in "character" (noòPòquotes).Œ Now move the cursor to the RP (REPLACE) field and type in "TribalòPòWarrior" (no quotes).Œ This function is performed from the cursor down, so ifòPòyou want toòPòsearch and replaceòPòthrough the entire text, you have to move to the top of the text before you hitòPòCTRL-A (for þAþþUþþTþþOþþMþþAþþTþþIþþCþþ þþSþþEþþAþþRþþCþþHþþ þþAþþNþþDþþ þþRþþEþþPþþLþþAþþCþþEþ).Œ So, first hit the HOME key oròPòCTRL-T, then CTRL-A, and then scroll through the text to see how LeScriptòPòperformed.Œ Wasn't that a lot easier than having to find the word and type inòPòits replacement yourself?Œ Think of how impossible that would have been on aòPòtypewriter!Œ And, this function can also be performed for individual searchesòPòand/or replaces by using CTRL-S and/or CTRL-R, respectively.òPòòPò	The quick, easy and powerful things that LeScript can do are almostòPòlimitless!!Œ LeScript gives you the ability to do practically anything you wantòPòto...the ability not only to arrange and re-arrange, edit and re-edit, but alsoòPòthe ability to use your printer to its maximum potential.Œ We are sure that byòPònow you are as convinced as we are about LeScript's ease of use and its greatòPòcapacity.Œ We encourage you to read through the LeScript instruction manual, ifòPòyou haven't already, and to try out the functions explained within it.Œ ThisòPòwill give you a greater knowledge of the hundreds of things you can do withòPòLeScript.Œ We believe LeScript is the best Word Processor on the IBM market.ŒòPòDon't you agree?!òPòòPò				Happy Writing,òPòòPò				Anitek Software ProductsòPò ðPð                                                                           
