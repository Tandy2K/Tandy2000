In order to use this image, write it to a fresh 5.25" floppy disk via ImageDisk 1.18(or better?), with the following options:

* Double-step: Off
* Full analysis: Yes
* Keep bad sector: Yes

Also, after you are done writing the image to disk, you MUST put a piece of tape over the write-protect notch on the side of the floppy, or the program WILL crash with a "Divide Overflow" error.

Happy flying!
